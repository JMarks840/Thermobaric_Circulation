# Thermobaric_Circulation
This Python code can be used to run a simple 1D simulation of a lake including thermobaricity by considering the in-situ density for stability.
Other influences like salinity, wind, etc. are excluded.
For details of the model see the dokumentation in the code.
An examplary model set up is given in "__main__.py".
